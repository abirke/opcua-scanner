# The ip ranges to scan. Can be either:
# A hostname
# A single IP address
# An IP address with a CIDR Suffix (such as 127.0.0.1/29),
# Or an IP range 127.0.0.1-20 will scan ip addresses 127.0.0.1 through 127.0.0.20.
# Hint: CIDR Suffix = Fixed bits of the IP from start on. Used to determine the size of the subnet.
# The larger the suffix, the smaller the part of the subnet that will be scanned.

# If nothing is specified here, the scanner will scan relative to the own ip address(es) with a CIDR suffix of 29.
